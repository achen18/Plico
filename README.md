# Plico
Fully custom split mechanical keyboard. Runs on ZMK software, controlling key functions and responsive lighting. Future iterations intend to use ultra low-profile switches and a case redesign to allow the two sides to fold together for portability. Firmware updates plan to incorporate layers and macros once the author thinks of what to use so many keys for.
